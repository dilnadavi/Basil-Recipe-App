# CPSC210: My Personal Project
## Prevent waste with Basil, a web-based application for cooks!
For my personal project, I wish to make a recipe-geared application. In the application, one can *select an array of ingredients and find recipes that incorporate those ingredients with further filtering.* For example, if a user has some eggplants that are starting to mold in the fridge, they can use this application to find recipes that incorporate the eggplant. What's useful and unique about this application is that you can *specify which ingredients you do not have* or *specify the maximum cook time alloted* -- in this way, the user can easily find ways to salvage forgotten ingredients in the fridge.

**Potential list of features:**
- Classification of recipes to certain ingredients and cooking time
- Filtering system based on user inputs
- Variety of recipes cited off the internet
- Visual aid when browsing recipes
- Ability to save recipes into an album

***Motivation:*** The audience for this application is anyone who is willing to follow a recipe -- whether they are an experienced homecook or an amateur in the kitchen. This application will be useful for anyone who has to make use of a specific array of ingredients with certain restrictions. I, for one, always find myself in such a position and thus procured interest in this concept. There were many times when I would buy an unfamiliar ingredient for a specific dish and have to throw the remaining bits out due to my lack of knowledge on its usage. Therefore, I hope this application would be useful for other homecooks like me who is overwhelmed with the limited filering on the wide selection of recipes available on the internet.
